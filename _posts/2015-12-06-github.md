Various projects and hacks on my [github](https://github.com/neilisaac) page including:

[lazycontract](https://github.com/neilisaac/lazycontract) is a library for declarative strongly-typed contract classes in Python (2 and 3 compatible.)

[sparsebitvector](https://github.com/neilisaac/sparsebitvector) is an implementation of a sparse bit vector, similar to LLVM's SparseBitVector class in Go.

[KeyboardClip](https://github.com/neilisaac/KeyboardClip) is an OpenSCAD design for a clip to merge the previous generation Apple bluetooth keyboard and magic touchpad.
